# Design system
I am no designer so I need some clear and standard guidelines. [Microsoft's Fluent 2](https://fluent2.microsoft.design/) design system is clear and used across different of their services. Users should be familiar with it.

Guidelines are available for the developers and various open source components library can be used to integrate existing Fluent 2 components to web applications.

# Components library
The idea would be to implement Microsoft's design system by relying on the `fluentui-blazor` library.
